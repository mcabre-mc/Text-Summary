# Automatic Text Summary
The code generates an automatic summary of the text file. 
  
## Required Libraries:
1. nltk.corpus - stopwords
2. nltk.cluster.util - cosine_distance
3. numpy
4. networkx
5. scipy
  
## How to execute the code: 
Use the TextSummary.ipynb to visualize step by step. Use an input txt file and run the code. 
Use the py files to and give input file name and run the code. 
  
## Inupt: 
 1. Input file name
 2. Topics to choose
   
## Sample Output:
Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions
It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments
Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions
When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger
Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions
This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers
The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today
Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward
Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders
Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins
Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets
If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible
What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party
Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future
Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.
